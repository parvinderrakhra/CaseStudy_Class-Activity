## What Is It?
RobinHood is an internet stock trading platform that offers unlimited commission free trading for
● stocks in U.S. public companies,
● ETF’s (exchange traded funds),
● Stock options, and
● Cryptocurrencies

How can they do this? Their revenue comes from sources that other brokers might consider ancillary,
such as
● Lending: RobinHood can lend the idle cash in its customers’ accounts, much as a bank does.
RobinHood can also lend stock held in customers’ accounts (Stock lending is a big business
because a short sale is actually a sale of borrowed shares, so short sales cannot proceed until the
relevant shares are borrowed.).
● Margin: For a fee, RobinHood extends credit to customers to buy securities with, an arrangement
known as “buying on margin”.
RobinHood customers primarily access the RobinHood trading platform via an easy-to-use mobile app, in
contrast to the PC focus of most of the more established players, such as Schwab or E*Trade. This, of
course, appeals to RobinHood’s target market, i.e. Millennials, a demographic segment that has been
under-served by established banks and brokerage firms. Another Millennial-friendly difference between
RobinHood and the others is that RobinHood accounts have no minimum deposit.
In 2018, RobinHood developed its own clearing operation (See below for link explaining this.).
Last December, RobinHood announced that they plan to offer no-fee, no-minimum checking accounts
with a 3% interest paid on account balances, a far better deal than established banks. This offering should
be viewed as part of a larger initiative to make “RobinHood look like a full-service consumer finance
company,” in the words of co-founder Baiju Bhatt (See link to CNBC story below).


# Why This Matters?

RobinHood’s fee structure (or, rather, no-fee structure) illustrates the dramatic cost savings that efficient
internet processing can provide. It also demonstrates how such processing can disrupt the
commission-based business model of other, more established on-line brokerages, such as Fidelity or
Charles Schwab. And on-line stock trading is an enormous business, serving as one of the two killer apps
that powered the growth of the internet in the 1990’s (the other was internet pornography).
Not surprisingly, then, RobinHood’s growth has been spectacular. Even though it was founded in 2013, it has more customers than E*Trade Financial, which was founded in 1982. Jan Hammer of Index
Ventures, an early investor, thinks that RobinHood will indeed execute on Bhatt’s vision, stating
“They’re going to be the Amazon of financial services.”
Certainly, there is much in financial services that is ripe for disruption. Why do average credit card
interest rates hover at 14% per annum, for example, even though credit card providers also extract
additional transaction fees from merchants? OK, these interest charges and fees must cover lots of credit
card fraud, but the incumbents are not doing as much as they could to mitigate it (like eliminating the
deluge of unsolicited credit card mail-in offerings that criminals can so easily use to generate phony
accounts).
